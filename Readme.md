# UC Realtime Editor
This is a realtime editor built for Unrestricted Coding. It allows you to work with HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a realtime preview and an option to do a realtime collaboration section.

This currently has Bootstrap loaded into it by default, but you may change the settings and included JavaScript references using the settings button the the left.

You can also disable the live preview window or syncing by using the green and blue toggles on the left.

To share your session with someone and have them join in then click the yello collaboration button on the left.

Currently there are quite a few bugs still on this editor, but they will get fixed. This editor's version is Pre-Release ALPHA v0.0.1
